NOTES

It was chosen quality over speed on the development of this app but too much time was lost 
because of the unfamiliarity with the limitations of the Room database regarding fulltext search and finding alternatives to accomplish what was required
and being the first time in using an InputStream on a GET call an parse it to a CSV format while searching a comprehensive way to present a progress bar to the user.
